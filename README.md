Shorty
================
A URL shortener

## Setup on a Linux box

### Dependencies

#### Ruby

Shorty uses Ruby version 2.3.1 and it has a `.ruby-version` file which is used by [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

#### SQLite3

Shorty uses SQLite3 to store data. To install it use:
`sudo apt-get install sqlite3`

## Development

To kick start your development environment, shorty comes with a tmux session starter script (`shorty-dev.sh`) but before you can use it, you need to make sure you have `tmux` installed.

Check if `tmux` is installed using: `which tmux`.

To install `tmux` use: `sudo apt-get install tmux`

Change the mode of the script to executable using: `chmod +x shorty-dev.sh`.
From within the root directory of this repository run `./shorty-dev.sh` to start you preset `tmux` session.

## Testing

Shorty uses `rspec` for tests. To run all tests use the command `rspec` from within the root directory of this repository.
On Shorty, `rspec` is configured by default to run in a test environment, so you don't have to worry about adding extra env variables.

## Documentation

Shorty is documented using [yard](https://yardoc.org/). If you used the preset `tmux` session, `yard` server should be running on port 8808 unless you have another process using the same port.

If you want to manually run it use `yard server`.
